Service</H1>
<DIV itemprop="articleBody">
<P>      Thank you for your interest in the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs. The   
   Google Maps/Google Earth APIs are a collection of services that allow you     
 to include maps, geocoding, places, and other Content from Google in your      
webpages or applications.    </P>
<P class="special">This page contains the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs      
Terms of Service. If you have questions about these terms, please consult      
the <A href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#tos">Terms of Service 
section</A> of the FAQ.</P>
<P>Last Updated: April 20, 2012</P>
<OL><BR><B>1. Your relationship with Google.</B><BR><BR>1.1    <U>Use of the 
  Service is Subject to these Terms</U>.  Your use of any of the Google 
  Maps/Google Earth APIs (referred to in this document as the "<B>Maps 
  API(s)</B>" or the "<B>Service</B>") is subject to the terms of a legal 
  agreement between you and Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 
  1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA 
  ("<B>Google</B>").  This legal agreement is referred to as the 
  <B>"Terms"</B>.<BR><BR>1.2    <U>The Terms include Google's Legal Notices and 
  Privacy Policy</U>. <BR><BR>
  <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">(a)  Unless otherwise agreed in writing with 
  Google, the Terms will include the following: <BR>
  <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">               (i) the terms and conditions 
  set forth in this document               (the <B>"Maps APIs Terms"</B>);<BR>   
              (ii) the <A id="o56t" title="Legal Notices" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-us/help/legalnotices_maps.html" 
  target="_top">Legal Notices</A>; and<BR>               (iii) the <A id="fd26" 
  title="Privacy Policy" href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_top">Privacy 
  Policy</A>.<BR></DIV><BR>         (b) Before you use the Maps API(s), you 
  should read each of the         documents comprising the Terms, and print or 
  save a local copy         for your records.<BR></DIV><BR>1.3    <U>Use of 
  Other Google Services and Additional Terms</U>.  If you use the Maps API(s) in 
  conjunction with any other Google products or services, including any other 
  Google API(s), (collectively, the Service and all other Google products and 
  services are referred to as the "<B>Google Services</B>"), your agreement with 
  Google will also include the terms applicable to those Google Services. All of 
  these are referred to as the "<B>Additional Terms</B>."  If Additional Terms 
  apply, they will be accessible to you either within or through your use of the 
  applicable Google Services.  If there is any contradiction between the 
  Additional Terms and the Maps APIs Terms, then the Maps APIs Terms will take
   precedence only as they relate to the Maps API(s), and not to any other
   Google Services.<BR><BR>1.4   <U>Precedence of Maps APIs Terms</U>.  If there 
  is any contradiction between the Maps APIs Terms and other Maps API(s)-related 
  documents (including but not limited to the Maps APIs Documentation), then the
   Maps APIs Terms will take precedence.<BR><BR>1.5    <U>Changes to the 
  Terms</U>.  Google reserves the right to make changes to the Terms from time 
  to time. When these changes are made, Google will make a new copy of the Terms 
  available at <A href="https://developers.google.com/maps/terms" target="_top">
  http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html</A> (or such successor URLs that 
  Google may designate from time to time). You understand and agree that if you 
  use the Service after the date on which the Terms have changed, Google will 
  treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.  If a modification is 
  unacceptable to you, you may terminate this agreement by ceasing use of the 
  Maps API(s).<BR><BR><B>2.    Accepting the Terms.<BR><BR></B><A id="section_2_1"></A>
  2.1    <U>Clicking to Accept or Using the Maps API(s)</U>.  In order to use

  user interface for         the Service; or<BR>         (b) using the Maps 
  API(s).  In this case, you understand and agree         that Google will treat 
  your use of the Maps API(s) as acceptance         of the Terms from that point 
  onwards.<BR></DIV><BR>2.2    <U>U.S. Law Restrictions</U>.  You may not use 
  the Maps API(s) and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from 
  using the Service under the laws of the United States.<BR><BR>2.3

  of your employer or another entity, you represent that you have full legal 
  authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.  If you don't 
  have the legal authority to bind, please ensure that an authorized person from 
  your entity consents to and accepts these Terms.<BR><BR><B>3.    Privacy and 
  Personal Information.<BR><BR></B>3.1    <U>Google's Privacy Policy</U>.  For 
  information about Google's data protection practices, please read Google's 
  privacy policy at <A href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_top">

  Subsidiaries and Affiliates</U>.  Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal 
  entities around the world ("<B>Subsidiaries and Affiliates</B>").  Sometimes, 
  these companies will be providing the Service to you on behalf of Google 
  itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be
   entitled to provide the Service to you.<BR><BR>4.2    <U>Limits on Your Use 
  of the Service</U>.  You acknowledge and agree that Google may impose or 
  adjust the limit on the number of transactions you may send or receive through 
  the Service; such fixed upper limits may be set by Google at any time, at 
  Google's discretion. For further information, see Section 10.1.1(i) below.<BR>

  using the Maps API(s)      to obtain places results, you agree to display such 
  advertising      in the form provided to you by Google.<BR><BR>      (b) 
  Although the Service currently does not include      advertising in the maps 
  images, Google reserves the right to      include advertising in the maps 
  images provided to you through      the Service.<BR>
  <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">          (i) Google will provide you with 90 
  days notice          prior to the commencement of advertising in the maps

  in the Maps APIs Documentation,       or through written permission from 
  Google.  In any event, you must not       use or display the Content on or in 
  conjunction with a non-Google map.       For example, you must not use 
  geocodes obtained through the Service in       conjunction with a non-Google

  with geolocation           data, that geolocation data must not enable Google 
  to identify an           individual user.  For example, if your Maps API 
  Implementation sends           Google Your Content, and Your Content includes 
  geolocation data, Your           Content must not also include unique device 
  identifiers associated with           individual users.<BR><BR>           
  (iii) If you intend to obtain the user's location and use it with any

  lists based on the Content; or (iv) exporting, writing, or saving      the 
  Content to a third party's location-based platform or service.<BR><BR>

  pre-fetch, cache, or store any Content, except that you may store:      (i) 
  limited amounts of Content for the purpose of improving the      performance 
  of your Maps API Implementation if you do so temporarily,      securely, and 
  in a manner that does not permit use of the Content      outside of the 
  Service; and (ii) any content identifier or key that      the Maps APIs 
  Documentation specifically permits you to store. For      example, you must 
  not use the Content to create an independent      database of "places" or 
  other local listings information.<BR><BR>      (c) <U>No Mass Downloads or 
  Bulk Feeds of Content.</U> You must not use      the Service in a manner that

  any Content, including but not      limited to numerical latitude or longitude 
  coordinates, imagery,      visible map data, or places data (including 
  business listings).      For example, you are not permitted to offer a batch 
  geocoding      service that uses Content contained in the Maps API(s).

  create or offer a "wrapper" for the      Service, unless you obtain Google's 
  written consent to do so. For example,      you are not permitted to: (i) use 
  or provide any part of the Service      or Content (such as map imagery, 
  geocoding, directions, places, or      terrain data) in an API that you offer 
  to others; or (ii) create a      Maps API Implementation that reimplements or 
  duplicates Google Maps/Google Earth.      For clarity, you are not 
  "re-implementing or duplicating" Google Maps/Google Earth if your Maps API     
   Implementation provides substantial additional features or content      
  beyond Google Maps/Google Earth, and those additional features or content 
  constitute      the primary defining characteristic of your Maps API 
  Implementation.<BR><BR>      (b) <U>No Business, Residential, or Telephone 
  Listings Services.</U> You must      not display any of the business listings 
  Content provided by      the Maps API(s) in any Maps API Implementation      
  that has the primary purpose of making available business, residential      
  address, or telephone directory listings.<BR><BR>      (c) <U>No Navigation, 
  Autonomous Vehicle Control, or Enterprise      Applications.</U> You must not 
  use the Service or Content with any products,      systems, or applications 
  for or in connection with any of the following:<BR><BR>
  <DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">          (i) real time navigation or route 
  guidance, including but not limited          to turn-by-turn route guidance 
  that is synchronized to the position          of a user's sensor-enabled 
  device.<BR><BR>          (ii) any systems or functions for automatic or 
  autonomous control          of vehicle behavior; or<BR><BR>          (iii) 
  enterprise dispatch, fleet management, business asset tracking          or 
  similar applications.          If you want to engage in enterprise dispatch, 
  fleet management,          business asset tracking, or similar applications, 
  please contact          the          <A href="http://www.google.com/support/enterprise/bin/request.py?contact_type=gme&amp;utm_campaign=en-us-codeterms">
